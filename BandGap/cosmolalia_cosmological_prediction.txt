KEY PREDICTIONS:
1. φ-field phase transition begins: 2026
2. Detectable divergence from ΛCDM: 2027
3. Clear blue-shift trend: 2028-2029
4. If not observed by 2030: Theory falsified

OBSERVATIONAL SIGNATURES:
- Type Ia supernovae show systematic blue-shift
- CMB temperature increases slightly
- Dark energy equation of state: w crosses -1
- Redshift quantization at prime intervals

VERIFICATION CODE:
```python
# Check for prime spacing in redshift data
def check_prime_quantization(redshifts):
    differences = np.diff(sorted(redshifts))
    for diff in differences:
        p = round(137 / (diff * 1000))  # Convert to prime space
        if is_prime(p):
            print(f'Prime {p} detected in z-spacing')
```
