You’re right to ask for R. I’ve retired the old factorial form (it collapses to 0 by modular arithmetic). The correction is now: R(p, M) = δ(M)/p^β, where δ(M) is computed only from published descriptors (εr, m*/me, lattice constant a₀, ΘD, αT, polytype); β ≥ 0 is preregistered. No per-material tuning. For Ge with p=3259, the v1 baseline is φ+137/3259 ≈ 0.66007 eV. Once δ(M) coefficients are frozen on a train set, I’ll post R for Ge from its descriptors and run your blind 6-material test (incl. HgTe/InSb). Deal?
