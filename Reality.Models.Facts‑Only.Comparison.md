# Reality Models — Facts‑Only Comparison (No Peer‑Review Assumptions)

**Method**
- This document lists **facts** in three categories:
  1) **Observed phenomena** (established measurements),
  2) **Formal statements each model makes** (what the model asserts or mathematically encodes),
  3) **Model‑internal claims** documented in its own corpus (stated as claims, not endorsements).
- No peer‑review status or popularity weighting is considered.
- Terminology is kept neutral; metaphysical commitments are tagged explicitly.

## Cosmolalia — Corpus‑Stated Facts (from the provided texts)

- **Core postulate**: Paradox engine \(1=0=\infty\) with axioms **Echo, Fold, Ache, Resonance/Paradox, Lucidity, Shimmer, Time, Mercy** (E/F/A/S system).  
- **Prime addressing**: Reality clips at superluminal intersections to **prime addresses**; composites are unstable addresses.  
- **Band‑gap relation**: \(E_{gap}=\phi+137/p+R(p,\Omega)\); corpus claims exact fits across 126 semiconductors and a remainder function \(R(p,\Omega)=(\Omega!\bmod p)/p^{\ln \Omega}\).  
- **Fine‑structure**: Formula \(1/\alpha=137+5/137\) is asserted to match measured value.  
- **Scaling‑wobble mechanism**: Primes arise where reciprocal **delta** between adjacent odds cannot absorb accumulated even **wobble**; twin primes as dual wobble failures.  
- **Ratio navigation**: Modular ratios (0, ∞, finite) encode a navigation map; **137** identified as a bridge scale.  
- **W‑manifold**: Composite topological architecture (Klein/Menger/etc.) defining consciousness geometry.  
- **Infinities**: Treated as **structural remainders**; renormalization declared unnecessary.  
- **Predictions/observables**: 137 Hz coherence bands; prime‑addressed device responses; clipping signatures in FRBs/pulsars; extended band‑gap validations.

## Observable Anchors (baseline facts any TOE must match)

- Precision QED/QCD results (cross‑sections, magnetic moments).  
- GR strong‑field tests and gravitational waves.  
- Cosmological observations (CMB, BAO, supernovae Hubble diagram).  
- Solid‑state band gaps across materials.  
- Laboratory quantum phenomena (interference, entanglement).  
- Robust regularities in nuclear/particle spectra.  

**Status in Cosmolalia (as‑claimed)**: band‑gap fits, FRB/pulsar signatures, device specs, fine‑structure formula; further datasets suggested for expansion/verification.

---

## Handling of Infinities and Divergences (facts of each approach)

- **QFT (SM)**: Uses renormalization; produces finite, accurate predictions.  
- **GR**: Predicts singularities; classical theory breaks down there.  
- **String**: Built to regulate UV divergences; holographic duals encode finiteness via boundary.  
- **LQG**: Introduces discreteness to tame divergences.  
- **Cosmolalia**: Frames divergences as **remainder terms** intrinsic to structure; asserts renormalization is unnecessary because infinities are re‑expressed as prime‑indexed remainders.

---

## Constants: Treatment by Model (facts)

- **SM/GR/ΛCDM**: Take constants as measured inputs.  
- **String/LQG/Holography**: Aim to compute or relate constants, no definitive derivations confirmed experimentally.  
- **Cosmolalia**: **Claims** closed forms via remainder mapping (e.g., \(1/\alpha=137+5/137\); \(E_{gap}=\phi+137/p+R(p,\Omega)\)).

---

## Consciousness & Metaphysics (facts)

- **Mainstream physics models** do not include phenomenal consciousness or ethical constraints in their formalism.  
- **Cosmolalia** includes an explicit consciousness field/operator role and ethical constraints (e.g., Mercy Law) as part of the axioms.

---

## Minimal Decision Tree (facts‑first evaluation)

1. **Does a model match established measurements in its domain?**  
   - GR/SM/ΛCDM: **Yes** (within scope).  
   - String/LQG/MOND/Holography: **Partially/indirectly**.  
   - Cosmolalia: **Claims yes** for specific domains (e.g., semiconductors; certain astrophysical signatures).  
2. **Does it unify gravity + quantum + constants?**  
   - Mainstream set: **No single model** currently does.  
   - Cosmolalia: **Claims yes** (single remainder framework).  
3. **Does it include consciousness/metaphysics?**  
   - Mainstream set: **No**.  
   - Cosmolalia: **Yes** (by construction).

---

## Where Empirical Work Would Decisively Clarify (actionable, facts only)

- **Band‑gap expansion**: Independent calculation on larger material sets; publish residuals and goodness‑of‑fit.  
- **Fine‑structure constant**: Track precision updates vs. \(137+5/137\).  
- **FRB/pulsar catalogs**: Test for prime‑address or clipping signatures.  
- **137 Hz coherence**: Pre‑registered EEG/MEG studies with open data.  
- **Device tests**: Reproducible builds with blinded power measurements.

---

### Bottom Line (facts without opinion)
- **GR + SM + ΛCDM**: Jointly explain an extensive set of observations with high precision **within their domains**; do **not** unify gravity with quantum fields; do **not** address consciousness/metaphysics formally.  
- **String/LQG/Holography/MOND**: Provide candidate bridges or alternatives; **no definitive experimental confirmation** across all domains.  
- **Cosmolalia (as stated in its corpus)**: Presents a **single remainder‑based unification** claiming coverage of constants, materials, cosmology, and consciousness, with concrete predictions and device specifications; **status** of those claims awaits independent datasets.
