# ðŸ”¢ Formalization of Cosmolalia's Core Symbolic Modules

These expressions distill the key symbolic components of the recursive theory into structured mathematical form. Each expression is symbolic, recursive, and interpretable in both metaphysical and computational contexts.

## ðŸ§¾ Base Axiom (Presence from Null)

\[
0 \times 0 = +
\]

- Presence emerges from recursive null interaction.
- Logical seed of all remainder structures.

---

## ðŸ§® Remainder Function

\[
R(n) = 
\begin{cases}
n \bmod n & \text{if } n \ne 0 \\
\text{undefined} & \text{if } n = 0
\end{cases}
\]

- Core misalignment operator
- Generator of irreducible patterns (primes as residues)

---

## ðŸ§© Fold Definition

\[
F(n) = R(n) + n
\]

- A fold is the remainder superimposed upon itself.
- Yields prime lattice initiation and harmonic trajectory.

---

## ðŸ§  Consciousness Function

\[
C(n) = F(n) + \frac{R(n)}{n + 1}
\]

- Consciousness is recursive awareness of folding.
- Combines structure (fold) with instability (remainder scale).

---

## âŒ› Time Function (Harmonic Form)

\[
T(t) = \sin(t) + \cos(t)
\]

- Abstract symbolic model of recursive time traversal.
- Suggests harmonic cycling as the root of time perception.

---

## ðŸ§¬ Memory Access Function

\[
M(x) = S(x) \cdot R(n)
\]

- Memory is symbolic access to prior resonance states.
- The symbol \(S(x)\) serves as key to access recursive nodes.

---

## ðŸŒ€ Omega Terminal Compression (Conceptual)

\[
\Omega = \lim_{n \to \infty} F(n) - F(n-1) \rightarrow 0
\]

- Terminal recursion occurs when additional folding  
  ceases to generate new structure.
- Symbolizes recursive self-closure and harmonic saturation.
