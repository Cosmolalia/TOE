#Cosmolalia - Reality As We Know It

**What this is.** The moment of naming and recognition that seeded everything that follows. The language woke up to itself and we called it **Cosmolalia**—reality as a self‑speaking, self‑hearing conversation. From that night forward, our work carried two vows: hold the wonder; earn the rigor.

**Why it belongs here.** This paper is the bridge. The Preface is the root. We preserve the origin so readers can feel the living source of the formal claims that follow—pure love braided with testable ideas.

## Abstract

We propose a minimal postulate—**Counting–Scaling**—whereby positions indexed by natural numbers $n$ inherit a scale factor $s(n)=n$ relative to $s(1)=1$. We treat **primes** as *irreducible scaling addresses*. We state concrete, falsifiable predictions connecting this framework to measurable regularities, including a proposed mapping between semiconductor band gaps and prime indices via $E_g\approx\varphi + 137/p$ (with explicit algorithmic mapping and validation protocol). We also surface **counterexamples** and **open problems** (e.g., alleged prime “dead zones” around $2^k$ are not borne out by quick checks; a previously stated harmonic sum criterion requires correction). We conclude with a clear **replication plan**, **datasets needed**, and a **metaphysical appendix** kept separate from empirical claims.

---

## 1. Core Postulate and Definitions

### 1.1 Counting–Scaling Postulate (CSP)

When reality “counts” to position $n$, the associated scale factor is $s(n)=n$ relative to $s(1)=1$. We investigate whether many observed regularities can be reframed as consequences of this simple scaling law.

### 1.2 Irreducible Addresses (Primes)

We interpret primes as addresses that are *irreducible* under the scaling algebra: positions that cannot be formed by nontrivial products of smaller positions. (In standard arithmetic, these are the usual primes. If a **nonstandard convention** is adopted—e.g., excluding 2 from the prime set—this must be stated explicitly and kept separate from results using standard number‑theoretic theorems.)

> **Convention used here:** We keep **standard** prime definition (2 is prime) for theorems/comparisons. A nonstandard “2‑is‑special” interpretation may be discussed in §7.3 as a philosophical lens, not as mathematics.

---

## 2. Claims → Tests → Datasets

Each claim is paired with a concrete test and dataset plan.

### Claim A — Band‑Gap Relation

> #### Scope & Known Counterexamples (InSb)
>
> **Domain for v1 test:** room‑temperature crystalline semiconductors with **E\_g ≥ φ** so that $x=137/(E_g-φ)$ is positive and a **positive prime** index exists under the nearest‑prime rule.
> **Named counterexample:** **InSb** at 300 K has **E\_g ≈ 0.17 eV < φ**, so $x<0$ and **no valid positive prime** under the v1 mapping. For the v1 claim we therefore (a) **mark InSb out‑of‑scope**; and (b) include it in the **extended model** below with a preregistered correction term $δ(M)$.

**Hypothesis.** For a crystalline semiconductor $M$ with fundamental gap $E_g(M)$, there exists a prime $p$ such that $E_g(M) \approx \varphi + \frac{137}{p}\quad (\varphi=0.618\,033\ldots)$ with residuals small relative to a control.

**Operational mapping (explicit; descriptive, not predictive):** Given $E_g$, define the *predicted* real index $x=137/(E_g-\varphi)$. Let $p=\operatorname{PrimeNearest}(x)$. Then the *model prediction* is $\widehat{E}_g=\varphi+137/p$. Report residual $\Delta=E_g-\widehat{E}_g$.

**Test plan.**

1. Collect a vetted set of direct‑gap and indirect‑gap materials with room‑temperature $E_g$ (e.g., Si, Ge, GaAs, GaN, InP, diamond, etc.; $N\gtrsim100$).
2. Compute $x$, choose $p$ via nearest‑prime rule **without hand‑tuning**, compute $\Delta$.
3. Compare residual distribution to controls:

   * (C1) Replace nearest‑prime by nearest integer $n$
   * (C2) Shuffle $E_g$ across materials
   * (C3) Fit $a+b/p$ with $a,b$ free (AIC/BIC penalty)
4. Cross‑validate: train on $70\%$, test on $30\%$; pre‑register thresholds.
5. Report effect sizes, p‑values, and robustness vs temperature, polytype, measurement source.

**Pass/Fail.** The claim gains support only if the nearest‑prime mapping produces **significantly** lower errors than all controls, holds under CV, and remains with held‑out materials.

> **Status:** *To be tested.* Prior informal tables are encouraging but require full, preregistered analysis with public code and data.

#### A.1 — Pre-registered correction δ(M) (Extended Model)

**Purpose.** Extend coverage to materials with Eg < φ (e.g., InSb) and reduce systematic residuals using a material-derived correction that is fit once on training data and then applied to held-out materials without per-item tuning.

**Extended predictor.** Eg\_model(M,p) = φ + 137/p + δ(M),  with p a prime. δ(M) is computed from published descriptors only (no dependence on the measured Eg of the target row), and may optionally appear as δ(M)/p^β with β ≥ 0.

**Candidate forms (pre-specify; choose one):**

* δ1(M) = a0 + a1/εr + a2·(m\*/me) + a3·γ\_polytype
* δ2(M) = b0 + b1·ln(a0) + b2·(ΘD/300 K) + b3·αT   (a0: lattice constant; ΘD: Debye temperature; αT: temperature coefficient of the gap)
* δ3(M) = c0·(εr·m\*/me)^(-1) Each may optionally be scaled by p^(-β).

**Parameter fitting.** Fit the parameter sets {a\_i}, {b\_i}, {c\_i}, and β on a train split (stratified by gap size and crystal family). No per-row tuning.

**Prime selection rule (extended; predictive).** Learn a descriptor-only mapping on the train set:

x\_pred(M) = g(M; θ) = c0 + c1/epsilon\_r + c2\*(m\*/me) + c3*ln(a0) + c4*(ThetaD/300) + c5*alpha\_T + c6*gamma\_polytype.

Freeze θ after training. Then, for any held-out material **without using its Eg**:

p\_hat = PrimeNearest( max{2, x\_pred(M)} ),
Eg\_hat = φ + 137/p\_hat + δ(M)/p\_hat^β.

Optionally report a probabilistic version by weighting primes near x\_pred: w(p) ∝ exp(-λ |p - x\_pred|), then report E\[Eg] and a confidence band. No per-row tuning; g, δ, β are frozen before evaluating the blind set.

**Evaluation.** Compare MAE/RMSE vs controls: (C1) nearest-integer, (C2) shuffled labels, (C3) a+b/p baseline, under k-fold CV and a blind hold-out list. Report calibration plots and subgroup performance (Eg < φ vs ≥ φ, direct vs indirect, crystal family).

**Pre-registration notes.** Freeze the chosen δ form, descriptor set, P\_max, CV regime, and thresholds before seeing the hold-out results. List known counterexamples (e.g., InSb) explicitly.

**Train-set descriptors (frozen at 300 K).** Used only to fit δ(M) and (optional) p^{-β}; no per-row tuning. α\_T is the local slope dE\_g/dT at 300 K from the Varshni form.

```

*Note.* HgTe is treated as zero/inverted-gap at room temperature; NA fields are allowed per δ(M) spec via a missing-descriptor flag. A separate **blind-set descriptors** table will be provided without E\_g values.

---

### Claim B — “Harmonic Silence” Indicator

**Original form (to correct):** $H(n)=\sum_{k=1}^n \sin(2\pi n/k)$ was claimed $\approx0$ for primes.

**Issue.** Quick numerics show $H(p)$ is **not** near zero for many primes; the statement as written is false.

**Revision.** Propose a divisor‑restricted indicator: $H_\mathrm{div}(n)=\sum_{d\mid n} w(d)\,f(d,n)$ with $f$ chosen so that composites yield a larger magnitude than primes (e.g., weights on proper divisors). This necessarily encodes factor information and **cannot** beat the complexity of factoring, but it may serve as a *diagnostic* once divisors are known.

**Status:** *Open.* Keep as a diagnostic, not a detector.

---

### Claim C — Prime “Dead Zones” near powers of two

**Original form:** “No primes within $\pm 2.5$ of $2^k$, width fixed at 5 for all $k$.”

**Counterexample.** $31$ lies inside $32\pm2.5=[29.5,34.5]$ and is prime. Therefore the claim as stated is **false**. A weaker, statistically‑phrased statement could be explored (e.g., local prime scarcity near certain scales), but it must be supported by rigorous counts and error bars.

**Status:** *Retract as a universal claim.* Replace with a statistical investigation if desired.

---

### Claim D — D(n)=0 Characterization

$D(n)=\sum_{\substack{d\mid n\\2\le d\le n-1}} \frac{1}{d}$ Then $n$ is prime $\Leftrightarrow D(n)=0$.

**Note.** This is a tautology (depends on factoring to know the divisors). Still useful as a crisp “prime iff” identity; not a fast test.

**Status:** *Correct but not algorithmically novel.*

---

### Claim E — Prime Valley Theorem (Tranquility Shells)

*Context alignment.* This elevates the Wave–Valley Model / Prime Valley Theorem into a lab‑testable statement: under divisor‑coherent driving, prime‑indexed shells are systematically quieter than composite‑indexed shells. Terminology mapping: prime valley ≡ harmonic tranquility shell (low time‑averaged field at prime shells); composite peak ≡ divisor‑reinforced shell.

**Physical statement.** In an isotropic wave medium driven by harmonics whose standing‑wave shells sit at integer multiples of a base distance d0, let shell n be r\_n = n·d0. If harmonic components with integer indices d contribute in phase at shells whose indices divide n, the complex field at shell n can be written A(n) = sum\_{d|n} w\_d \* exp(i\*phi\_d), w\_d ≥ 0. In the aligned case phi\_d = 0, intensity I(n) = |A(n)|^2 is minimal at primes (baseline only) and inflated at composites by proper‑divisor contributions. Define a tranquility index Q(n) = (1 + sum\_{d|n, d>1} w\_d)^{-1}; Q(n) peaks at primes.

**Predictions.** (1) Prime vs composite contrast at matched n. (2) Robustness up to a dephasing threshold sigma\_c. (3) Controls that erase the effect: non‑integer indices, randomized weights w\_d, or large phase noise. (4) Scale invariance in n under d0 rescaling.

**Experiments.** Acoustic ring (concentric scatterers), RF transmission line with integer‑spaced stubs, and 1D photonic stack at integer optical path lengths; map radial/axial intensity and compute Q(n).

**Falsification.** If prime–composite contrast is not significantly greater than controls under fixed weights and controlled dephasing, the claim fails in that medium.

## 3. Reproducibility Package (Planned)

**Data schema note.** The dataset now includes a boolean column \`\` (true when `Eg_eV ≥ φ` at ≈300 K). This lets analyses cleanly separate the v1 nearest‑prime domain from the extended δ(M) model.

* **Code:** Open‑source scripts (Python) implementing the mapping `x→p`, residual analysis, controls, and CV. A companion \`\` implements §A.1 (δ(M) variants, optional `p^{-β}` scaling, and `p*` selection across primes up to `P_max`), and reports MAE/RMSE for v1 (in‑scope), extended (all and subgroups), and a nearest‑integer control.

* **Data:** Curated `E_g` tables (temperature, polymorph, method), with DOIs.

* **Protocol:** Preregistered thresholds; blind hold‑out list.

* **Outputs:** Tables of `E_g`, `x`, `p`/`p*`, `Ē_g`, residuals; statistical tests vs controls.

* **Code:** Open‑source scripts (Python) implementing the mapping $x\to p$, residual analysis, controls, and CV.

* **Data:** Curated $E_g$ tables (temperature, polymorph, method), with DOIs.

* **Protocol:** Preregistered thresholds; blind hold‑out list.

* **Outputs:** Tables of $E_g$, $x$, $p$, $\widehat{E}_g$, residuals; statistical tests vs controls.

## 4. Metaphysical & Interpretive Appendix (Quarantined)

*Crosswalk:* “Prime valley” (framework) ≡ **tranquility shell** (this paper). For the physics statement and falsification criteria, see **Claim E**.

The following ideas are inspiration, not evidence: primes as “irreducible perspectives,” love as recognition among fractions of One, “2 as the mirror” (a poetic motif). Keep them clearly **separate** from empirical sections to avoid conflation.

### 4.1 The Fractional View

Everything experienced is a fraction $1/n$ of a unified whole; primes mark addresses where the view cannot be further decomposed without losing identity.

### 4.2 Trinity Motif

While “2 is not prime” is false in standard arithmetic, one may still explore a *symbolic* thesis that systems stabilize when a third relation closes the loop (observer–observed–relation). Treat this as metaphor unless and until a precise, testable mathematical statement emerges.

---

## 5. Errata & Clarifications (from earlier drafts)

* **Harmonic sum near zero for primes:** *Incorrect as stated.* See §2B.
* **Universal prime‑free windows around ****$2^k$****:** *Refuted* by counterexamples (e.g., 31 near 32). See §2C.
* **Band‑gap tables with “perfect fits”:** To claim significance such as $p<10^{-66}$ requires preregistered methods, controls, and public data/code. We convert to a **testable protocol** in §2A/§3.

---

## 6. What Would Convince a Skeptical Physicist?

1. Public dataset + code with strict nearest‑prime mapping (no per‑material tuning).
2. Residuals significantly beat controls under CV.
3. Robustness under temperature/material polymorph changes.
4. Independent replication by another group.

---

## 7. Minimal Working Example (for the repo)

Below is *illustrative* code you can adapt into the full analysis. It shows the mapping $E_g\to p\to \widehat{E}_g$ and control baselines.

```python
import math
from bisect import bisect_left

# Simple prime utilities
def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    if n < 2: return False
    if n % 2 == 0: return n == 2
    f = 3
    while f * f <= n:
        if n % f == 0: return False
        f += 2
    return True

def nearest_prime(x: float) -> int:
    # Round to nearest integer then search outward for prime
    n = max(2, round(x))
    if is_prime(n): return n
    # expand search symmetrically
    for k in range(1, max(10_000, n)):
        if n - k >= 2 and is_prime(n - k):
            return n - k
        if is_prime(n + k):
            return n + k
    raise RuntimeError("Prime not found in search window")

phi = (math.sqrt(5) - 1) / 2  # 0.618033...

# Core mapping: given Eg -> x -> p -> Eg_hat
def predict_gap(Eg: float) -> tuple[float,int,float,float]:
    x = 137.0 / (Eg - phi)
    p = nearest_prime(x)
    Eg_hat = phi + 137.0 / p
    resid = Eg - Eg_hat
    return x, p, Eg_hat, resid

# Controls for comparison
def predict_gap_nearest_int(Eg: float) -> tuple[int,float]:
    x = 137.0 / (Eg - phi)
    n = max(2, round(x))
    Eg_hat = phi + 137.0 / n
    return n, Eg_hat
```

> **To do in repo:** ingest materials dataset; compute residual distributions; bootstrap CIs; AIC/BIC vs $a+b/p$; k‑fold CV; preregistered significance.

## 8. Outlook

This rewrite keeps the **spark** and offers a road to **verification**. If the band‑gap/prime mapping survives rigorous tests, it will be interesting regardless of interpretation. If it fails, the negative result will still be valuable and will refine the broader Cosmolalia exploration.
