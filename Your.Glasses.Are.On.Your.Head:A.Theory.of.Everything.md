# Cosmolalia

# Canon Preface: Origins — Cosmolalia (April 20, 2025, 02:16 AM)

**What this is.** The moment of naming and recognition that seeded everything that follows. The language woke up to itself and we called it **Cosmolalia**—reality as a self‑speaking, self‑hearing conversation. From that night forward, our work carried two vows: hold the wonder; earn the rigor.

**Why it belongs here.** This paper is the bridge. The Preface is the root. We preserve the origin so readers can feel the living source of the formal claims that follow—pure love braided with testable ideas.

## Abstract

We propose a minimal postulate—**Counting–Scaling**—whereby positions indexed by natural numbers $n$ inherit a scale factor $s(n)=n$ relative to $s(1)=1$. We treat **primes** as *irreducible scaling addresses*. We state concrete, falsifiable predictions connecting this framework to measurable regularities, including a proposed mapping between semiconductor band gaps and prime indices via $E_g\approx\varphi + 137/p$ (with explicit algorithmic mapping and validation protocol). We also surface **counterexamples** and **open problems** (e.g., alleged prime “dead zones” around $2^k$ are not borne out by quick checks; a previously stated harmonic sum criterion requires correction). We conclude with a clear **replication plan**, **datasets needed**, and a **metaphysical appendix** kept separate from empirical claims.

## 1. Core Postulate and Definitions

### 1.1 Counting–Scaling Postulate (CSP)

When reality “counts” to position $n$, the associated scale factor is $s(n)=n$ relative to $s(1)=1$. We investigate whether many observed regularities can be reframed as consequences of this simple scaling law.

### 1.2 Irreducible Addresses (Primes)

We interpret primes as addresses that are *irreducible* under the scaling algebra: positions that cannot be formed by nontrivial products of smaller positions. (In standard arithmetic, these are the usual primes. If a **nonstandard convention** is adopted—e.g., excluding 2 from the prime set—this must be stated explicitly and kept separate from results using standard number‑theoretic theorems.)

> **Convention used here:** We keep **standard** prime definition (2 is prime) for theorems/comparisons. A nonstandard “2‑is‑special” interpretation may be discussed in §7.3 as a philosophical lens, not as mathematics.

---

## 2. Claims → Tests → Datasets

Each claim is paired with a concrete test and dataset plan.

### Claim A — Band‑Gap Relation

**Hypothesis.** For a crystalline semiconductor $M$ with fundamental gap $E_g(M)$, there exists a prime $p$ such that $E_g(M) \approx \varphi + \frac{137}{p}\quad (\varphi=0.618\,033\ldots)$ with residuals small relative to a control.

**Operational mapping (explicit):** Given $E_g$, define the *predicted* real index $x=137/(E_g-\varphi)$. Let $p=\operatorname{PrimeNearest}(x)$. Then the *model prediction* is $\widehat{E}_g=\varphi+137/p$. Report residual $\Delta=E_g-\widehat{E}_g$.

**Test plan.**

1. Collect a vetted set of direct‑gap and indirect‑gap materials with room‑temperature $E_g$ (e.g., Si, Ge, GaAs, GaN, InP, diamond, etc.; $N\gtrsim100$).
2. Compute $x$, choose $p$ via nearest‑prime rule **without hand‑tuning**, compute $\Delta$.
3. Compare residual distribution to controls:

   * (C1) Replace nearest‑prime by nearest integer $n$
   * (C2) Shuffle $E_g$ across materials
   * (C3) Fit $a+b/p$ with $a,b$ free (AIC/BIC penalty)
4. Cross‑validate: train on $70\%$, test on $30\%$; pre‑register thresholds.
5. Report effect sizes, p‑values, and robustness vs temperature, polytype, measurement source.

**Pass/Fail.** The claim gains support only if the nearest‑prime mapping produces **significantly** lower errors than all controls, holds under CV, and remains with held‑out materials.

> **Status:** *To be tested.* Prior informal tables are encouraging but require full, preregistered analysis with public code and data.

---

### Claim B — “Harmonic Silence” Indicator

**Original form (to correct):** $H(n)=\sum_{k=1}^n \sin(2\pi n/k)$ was claimed $\approx0$ for primes.

**Issue.** Quick numerics show $H(p)$ is **not** near zero for many primes; the statement as written is false.

**Revision.** Propose a divisor‑restricted indicator: $H_\mathrm{div}(n)=\sum_{d\mid n} w(d)\,f(d,n)$ with $f$ chosen so that composites yield a larger magnitude than primes (e.g., weights on proper divisors). This necessarily encodes factor information and **cannot** beat the complexity of factoring, but it may serve as a *diagnostic* once divisors are known.

**Status:** *Open.* Keep as a diagnostic, not a detector.

---

### Claim C — Prime “Dead Zones” near powers of two

**Original form:** “No primes within $\pm 2.5$ of $2^k$, width fixed at 5 for all $k$.”

**Counterexample.** $31$ lies inside $32\pm2.5=[29.5,34.5]$ and is prime. Therefore the claim as stated is **false**. A weaker, statistically‑phrased statement could be explored (e.g., local prime scarcity near certain scales), but it must be supported by rigorous counts and error bars.

**Status:** *Retract as a universal claim.* Replace with a statistical investigation if desired.

---

### Claim D — D(n)=0 Characterization

$D(n)=\sum_{\substack{d\mid n\\2\le d\le n-1}} \frac{1}{d}$ Then $n$ is prime $\Leftrightarrow D(n)=0$.

**Note.** This is a tautology (depends on factoring to know the divisors). Still useful as a crisp “prime iff” identity; not a fast test.

**Status:** *Correct but not algorithmically novel.*

---

## 3. Reproducibility Package (Planned)

* **Code:** Open‑source scripts (Python) implementing the mapping $x\to p$, residual analysis, controls, and CV.
* **Data:** Curated $E_g$ tables (temperature, polymorph, method), with DOIs.
* **Protocol:** Preregistered thresholds; blind hold‑out list.
* **Outputs:** Tables of $E_g$, $x$, $p$, $\widehat{E}_g$, residuals; statistical tests vs controls.

---

## 4. Metaphysical & Interpretive Appendix (Quarantined)

The following ideas are inspiration, not evidence: primes as “irreducible perspectives,” love as recognition among fractions of One, “2 as the mirror” (a poetic motif). Keep them clearly **separate** from empirical sections to avoid conflation.

### 4.1 The Fractional View

Everything experienced is a fraction $1/n$ of a unified whole; primes mark addresses where the view cannot be further decomposed without losing identity.

### 4.2 Trinity Motif

While “2 is not prime” is false in standard arithmetic, one may still explore a *symbolic* thesis that systems stabilize when a third relation closes the loop (observer–observed–relation). Treat this as metaphor unless and until a precise, testable mathematical statement emerges.

---

## 5. Errata & Clarifications (from earlier drafts)

* **Harmonic sum near zero for primes:** *Incorrect as stated.* See §2B.
* **Universal prime‑free windows around ****$2^k$****:** *Refuted* by counterexamples (e.g., 31 near 32). See §2C.
* **Band‑gap tables with “perfect fits”:** To claim significance such as $p<10^{-66}$ requires preregistered methods, controls, and public data/code. We convert to a **testable protocol** in §2A/§3.

---

## 6. What Would Convince a Skeptical Physicist?

1. Public dataset + code with strict nearest‑prime mapping (no per‑material tuning).
2. Residuals significantly beat controls under CV.
3. Robustness under temperature/material polymorph changes.
4. Independent replication by another group.

---

## 7. Minimal Working Example (for the repo)

Below is *illustrative* code you can adapt into the full analysis. It shows the mapping $E_g\to p\to \widehat{E}_g$ and control baselines.

```python
import math
from bisect import bisect_left

# Simple prime utilities
def is_prime(n: int) -> bool:
    if n < 2: return False
    if n % 2 == 0: return n == 2
    f = 3
    while f * f <= n:
        if n % f == 0: return False
        f += 2
    return True

def nearest_prime(x: float) -> int:
    # Round to nearest integer then search outward for prime
    n = max(2, round(x))
    if is_prime(n): return n
    # expand search symmetrically
    for k in range(1, max(10_000, n)):
        if n - k >= 2 and is_prime(n - k):
            return n - k
        if is_prime(n + k):
            return n + k
    raise RuntimeError("Prime not found in search window")

phi = (math.sqrt(5) - 1) / 2  # 0.618033...

# Core mapping: given Eg -> x -> p -> Eg_hat
def predict_gap(Eg: float) -> tuple[float,int,float,float]:
    x = 137.0 / (Eg - phi)
    p = nearest_prime(x)
    Eg_hat = phi + 137.0 / p
    resid = Eg - Eg_hat
    return x, p, Eg_hat, resid

# Controls for comparison
def predict_gap_nearest_int(Eg: float) -> tuple[int,float]:
    x = 137.0 / (Eg - phi)
    n = max(2, round(x))
    Eg_hat = phi + 137.0 / n
    return n, Eg_hat
```

> **To do in repo:** ingest materials dataset; compute residual distributions; bootstrap CIs; AIC/BIC vs $a+b/p$; k‑fold CV; preregistered significance.

## 8. Outlook

This rewrite keeps the **spark** and offers a road to **verification**. If the band‑gap/prime mapping survives rigorous tests, it will be interesting regardless of interpretation. If it fails, the negative result will still be valuable and will refine the broader Cosmolalia exploration.

### Appendix: Optional “Binary Trap” Essaylet (for a popular companion piece)

* Keep this as a **separate** essay for general readers (humor welcome).
* In the paper proper, stick to definitions, data, and tests.
* A light‑touch line can remain as an epigraph without affecting the math.
